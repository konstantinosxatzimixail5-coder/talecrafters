// Photoreal human captures, ported from the portfolio where they were first

//
// Each one is kept because it is hard in a specific and nameable way. A gallery
// of pretty faces proves nothing: a pretty face at rest is the easiest thing
// these models make. Skin under unflattering daylight, hands doing skilled
// work, two people in one frame with a real eyeline between them, wet ground
// throwing light back up. Those are the places a generated frame gives itself
// away, and those are what is on this shelf.
//
// Every one is labelled as generated wherever it appears. That is not modesty,
// it is the same rule that puts "spec" on the concept shelf.
//
// Order matters. The late shift opens because the reflection in it is the
// hardest thing here and the first place a sceptical eye goes.
