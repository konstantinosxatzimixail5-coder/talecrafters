        prompt: `SCENE CONTEXT
A lone red-armoured bladesman sprints across a rain-slick rooftop arena and takes the first strike from an engineered predator.

ACTIVE REFERENCES
@shogun_v1: adult male bladesman, lacquered red lamellar armour, horned silver helm, white waist wraps, blue energy katana in the right hand. 100% matches the reference.
@brute_v1: 2.8m grey-green reptilian predator, heavy shoulders, single orange thermal blade in the right claw. 100% matches the reference.
@arena_v1: open rooftop platform, dark metal panels, recessed cyan strips, standing rainwater.

LOCATION MAP
Camera 1.2m above the deck facing the far edge. Cyan strips run left to right through the midground. City glow and storm cloud fill the background. Rain falls near vertical, drifting screen-left.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
Frame opens on wet deck panels with @shogun_v1 already visible in the centre distance, running towards camera. @brute_v1 enters from screen-right at 0:02 and closes to within 2 metres. Both stand on the same strip line so the ground reads flat.

OPTICS
35mm for the run, 65mm for the strike. Deep focus on the deck, soft falloff on the city.

CAMERA
Low tracking move retreating with the run, then a hard whip to screen-right on the swing. Handheld weight, no float.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 @shogun_v1 runs at camera, water spraying off each footfall.
0:02 to 0:03 HARD CUT. @brute_v1 swings the thermal blade across frame, a red arc throws screen-left.
0:03 to 0:04 @shogun_v1 drops under the arc on one knee, katana trailing behind him.

PHYSICS
Rain beads and runs off armour plates. Water sheets under the sliding knee. Blood arcs and falls, it does not hang.

LIGHTING
Cold moonlight from behind, cyan uplight from the deck strips, orange rim off the thermal edge. Faces stay in shadow, no flat front light.

AUDIO
Rain on metal, one heavy blade pass, no music.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
Two figures only. Katana stays in the right hand. Blue for the katana, orange for the thermal edge, colours never swap.`,

        prompt: `SCENE CONTEXT
The bladesman squares off against the largest predator of the pack, which rises to full height under twin moons and opens its arms in challenge.

ACTIVE REFERENCES
@shogun_v1: red lamellar armour, horned silver helm, blue energy katana held low in a two-hand grip. 100% matches the reference.
@brute_v1: 2.8m grey-green predator, orange thermal blade in the right claw, chest and shoulder harness. 100% matches the reference.
@arena_v1: rooftop platform, cyan strips, heavy rain, two full moons low on the horizon behind the far edge.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
@shogun_v1 occupies the lower screen-left quarter, back three-quarters to camera, facing screen-right. @brute_v1 stands 4 metres away on the right, both moons directly behind its torso. Two dead predators lie in the far background as silhouettes.

OPTICS
85mm from a low deck-level position. The long lens compresses the moons to fill the sky behind the predator and stacks the two figures.

CAMERA
Slow rise from knee height to chest height, no pan. The predator grows in frame through camera height alone.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 @brute_v1 straightens from a hunch, thermal blade sweeping a slow arc at hip height.
0:02 to 0:03 It spreads both arms wide, head tipping back, chest open to camera.
0:03 to 0:04 @shogun_v1 shifts his weight onto the front foot and drops the katana tip towards the deck.

ACTING TASK
@shogun_v1 measures the reach of the blade, not the creature. He is deciding which distance kills him and stepping to the edge of it. The helm hides the face, so the task lives in the weight shift and in the tilt of the head tracking the blade tip.

PHYSICS
Rain runs off the thermal edge as steam. Muscle mass moves before the limb does. Water rings spread from each footfall.

LIGHTING
Moons act as a hard backlight and hold both figures as silhouettes. Cyan floor bounce separates the legs from the deck. No fill on the front.

AUDIO
Low breath, rain, the hum of the thermal edge. No music.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
Both moons stay visible and stay behind the predator. Two figures in the foreground, nothing else enters frame.`,

        prompt: `SCENE CONTEXT
The fight is over. The bladesman stands on top of the bodies he has made, blade driven down into the pile, blood running with the rain.

ACTIVE REFERENCES
@shogun_v1: red lamellar armour spattered dark, horned silver helm, both hands on the katana grip. 100% matches the reference.
@arena_v1: rooftop platform, cyan strips, twin moons low behind him, storm cloud.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
@shogun_v1 stands centre frame on a mound of dead predators roughly 1.5m high, facing camera, feet apart. The larger moon sits directly behind his helm, the smaller moon screen-right. Blood spray marks the deck in the foreground.

OPTICS
50mm from slightly below eye level. Neutral field, so the height comes from the low angle instead of distortion.

CAMERA
Static hold with a very slow creep in. The frame stops moving because the story does.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:01 Blood falls past camera in the foreground, out of focus.
0:01 to 0:03 @shogun_v1 drives the katana down into the pile and holds. Rain sheets off the shoulder plates.

ACTING TASK
He is listening for the next one. The stillness is work, not rest: the head turns two degrees at a time across the platform, checking whether anything is still breathing, and the grip stays closed the whole time.

PHYSICS
Bodies compress under his weight. The blade enters and stays. Rain runs off the helm crest in a continuous line.

LIGHTING
Hard rim from the moons, deep shadow across the front of the armour, cyan spill low on the corpses. Keep the face plate unreadable.

AUDIO
Rain, dripping, one long exhale.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
One living figure only. The blade stays vertical in the pile. The moons do not move between frames.`,

        prompt: `SCENE CONTEXT
On a second platform, a hooded assassin releases a ring of unstable energy that throws an entire security squad off their feet.

ACTIVE REFERENCES
@ronin_v1: tall hooded figure in layered shadow-weave, face void with no features, magenta phase poleblade. 100% matches the reference.
@trooper_v1: security troopers in dark segmented armour, full-face visors, compact rifles. Twelve of them.
@strike_v1: high-altitude combat platform, armoured composite panels, cyan inset strips, wet surface.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
Overhead view, camera directly above the deck. @ronin_v1 stands at the exact centre, poleblade held vertical. The troopers form a loose ring 6 to 9 metres out, all of them already airborne or falling outward. A magenta ring of light expands from the centre through the whole frame.

OPTICS
24mm top-down. The wide field keeps the full ring in frame and bends the platform edges outward for scale.

CAMERA
Locked overhead, then a fast fall to a low three-quarter angle on the deck at the cut.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 The magenta ring expands from @ronin_v1 outward, bodies thrown back with it, rifles leaving hands.
0:02 to 0:03 HARD CUT to a low angle behind @ronin_v1, two troopers closing from screen-right.
0:03 to 0:04 The poleblade sweeps once across frame, magenta trailing behind the edge.

PHYSICS
Bodies travel outward and tumble, they do not slide. Loose gear leaves at the same moment as the impact. Standing water lifts off the deck inside the ring.

LIGHTING
The ring is the only key light for two seconds and throws hard shadows outward from centre. Cyan deck strips read underneath. No ambient fill.

AUDIO
One low concussive hit, armour on metal, no music.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
One hooded figure only, never duplicated. Magenta belongs to the assassin, cyan belongs to the deck.`,

The assassin runs the length of the strike deck under fire from an interceptor while the last troopers shoot from the ground.

ACTIVE REFERENCES
@ronin_v1: hooded assassin, magenta phase poleblade held low and behind. 100% matches the reference.
@interceptor_v1: dark arrowhead jet with orange engine glow, banking above the platform.
@strike_v1: combat platform above the megacity, cyan strips, fallen troopers across the deck.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
High three-quarter view from the far corner of the platform. @ronin_v1 enters lower screen-left and runs a diagonal towards the far edge at screen-right. Cannon rounds walk across the deck one metre behind him for the whole run. @interceptor_v1 crosses the upper third from screen-right to screen-left.

OPTICS
28mm, high and wide, so the diagonal of the platform carries the run and the city drops away underneath.

CAMERA
Fast tracking move that leads the runner, then a whip up to the jet as it crosses.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 Impacts walk across the deck in a line behind @ronin_v1, sparks and panel fragments thrown up.
0:02 to 0:03 He plants one foot on the raised edge and leaps clear of the platform.
0:03 to 0:04 HARD CUT. Side view, the assassin closes on the fuselage of @interceptor_v1 in mid-air over the city.

PHYSICS
Sparks bounce and die on wet metal. Impacts throw water and debris in the same direction as travel. The leap keeps its arc, no hover.

LIGHTING
City neon underneath as a base glow, muzzle flashes as intermittent key, magenta trail from the blade. Keep the hood interior black.

AUDIO
Cannon fire, wind, one jet pass.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
One jet, one runner. The blade stays in the left hand through the leap.`,

The interceptor detonates above the city and the assassin rides a falling wing down towards the duel platform.

@ronin_v1: hooded assassin crouched on a sheared wing section, poleblade planted through the metal. 100% matches the reference.
@interceptor_v1: the jet, now a fireball and falling debris.
@arena_v1: duel platform below, cyan strips, wet panels, twin moons behind cloud.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
Wide side view over the megacity. The fireball fills the upper centre. @ronin_v1 sits in silhouette on the wing at lower centre, falling from screen-right to screen-left across frame. Tower blocks pass behind in the far background.

OPTICS
40mm on a long throw, so the explosion stays big without swallowing the silhouette.

CAMERA
Camera falls with the debris at matched speed. The background moves, the figure holds position in frame.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:01 The jet detonates, the shockwave clears the smoke outward.
0:01 to 0:02 @ronin_v1 is revealed inside the flash, crouched, cloak thrown flat by the airflow.
0:02 to 0:03 HARD CUT to the arena deck: the wing hits the far edge and the assassin lands in a low crouch, fire behind him.

PHYSICS
Fire rolls upward, debris keeps its forward momentum. The cloak follows airflow, not gravity. The landing takes weight through both legs and one hand.

LIGHTING
The blast is the key light for the whole block, orange on every surface. Magenta stays only on the blade. Rain lights up between camera and fire.

AUDIO
Detonation, then a low hollow roar and falling metal.

One figure on the debris. Fire behind, never in front of the silhouette.`,

@ronin_v1: hooded assassin, magenta poleblade angled down across the body. 100% matches the reference.
@arena_v1: duel platform, cyan strips, burning wreck on the far edge, rain and drifting smoke.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
@ronin_v1 stands screen-left in the near foreground, back three-quarters to camera, facing screen-right. @shogun_v1 stands screen-right, 5 metres away, facing screen-left. Eye lines meet across the centre of frame. The burning wreck sits between them in the background. Neither figure crosses the centre line until the last second of the block.

OPTICS
100mm from the side. Compression flattens the distance between them and stacks the fire directly behind.

CAMERA
Slow lateral dolly to screen-right, so the two figures swap depth relationship without either one moving.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 Both hold position. Only smoke, rain and cloth move.
0:02 to 0:04 @shogun_v1 turns his shoulders square and lifts the katana to a mid guard.
0:04 to 0:06 @ronin_v1 lowers into a wide stance and levels the poleblade at hip height.

ACTING TASK
Each one is looking for the tell in the other. The task is reading, not posing: the head tracks the opponent's weapon hand, then the front foot, then back to the hand. Whoever moves first has already lost the read, so both keep working and neither commits.

PHYSICS
Cloth and rain drift with the heat from the fire. Water runs off both weapons. Breath is visible in the cold.

LIGHTING
Orange from the wreck behind, cyan from the deck below, blue and magenta from the weapons. Faces and hood stay dark.

Fire, rain, no dialogue, no music.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
Open on a tight two-shot at chest height, blades crossed at the centre of frame, @ronin_v1 screen-left and @shogun_v1 screen-right. Both hold their side of frame for the whole block and never swap sides.

OPTICS
75mm for the lock, 32mm for the closing wide. Shallow field on the close work, deep on the wide.

CAMERA
Handheld pressure on the lock with small shakes on each shove, then a fast pull back to a locked wide for the final hold.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 The blades cross and grind, sparks thrown at the contact point, both fighters leaning in.
0:02 to 0:03 HARD CUT to a tight detail of the crossed edges and the gauntlets.
0:03 to 0:05 They shove apart, each taking two steps back on the wet deck.
0:05 to 0:07 HARD CUT to a wide from deck level. Both settle into low stances at opposite sides of frame and hold to the last frame.

PHYSICS
The energy edges throw sparks where they touch and light the water underneath. Feet slide slightly on the wet panels when they break. Mist parts around movement.

LIGHTING
Blade light is the key at close range, blue from the right and magenta from the left across both faces. Deck strips carry the wide.

Energy contact, boots on wet metal, rain, then near silence on the final hold.

A small pilot drops her glider off a high balcony and dives into a floating spire city at speed.

ACTIVE REFERENCES

@spires_v1: floating city of pale spires, waterfalls, arcane rings and cloud shelves under a violet sky.
@route_v1: position reference for direction of travel only.

LOCATION MAP
Camera starts above and behind the balcony, facing out over the city. The cathedral tower stands screen-right in the midground. Cloud sits below the balcony line. Light comes from the upper left.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
Frame opens on the city with @skyrunner_v1 already entering from the lower left. Travel runs screen-left to screen-right for the whole block. The camera holds 4 metres behind the tail and 1 metre above it.

OPTICS
18mm chase position. The wide field keeps both wings inside frame and lets the architecture stretch past at the edges.

CAMERA
Locked chase. The camera never overtakes and never falls behind. Roll follows the glider, horizon stays free to tilt.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 The glider drops past the balcony and the tower, wings level.
0:02 to 0:04 It banks left around the tower base, then rights itself.
0:04 to 0:05 It accelerates into open air above the cloud shelf.

PHYSICS
Wings hold their shape under load. Cloud tears past at the same speed as the architecture. The rider leans into the bank before the machine turns.

LIGHTING
Warm sun from the upper left, cold blue from the core at the nose, deep shade inside the canyon walls.

AUDIO
Wind, a low arcane hum, no music.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
One glider, one rider. Direction of travel stays constant. Wings stay attached and stay blue.`,

@skyrunner_v1: glider at full speed, core burning blue.
@spires_v1: rings, bridges and towers of the floating city.
@route_v1: position reference for direction of travel only.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
Open with the glider already in frame at centre, first ring 30 metres ahead and slightly screen-right. Three more rings sit beyond it at increasing distance. The camera holds the chase position behind and above.

OPTICS
16mm. The very wide field exaggerates the closing speed on each ring and keeps the far city readable.

CAMERA
Chase, with a small lag on each turn so the glider leads the frame and the camera catches up. No cuts inside the block.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 Straight run at the first ring, wings level, passing through the centre.
0:02 to 0:03 Hard roll to the right through a narrow bridge span.
0:03 to 0:05 A climbing turn back to the left, second and third rings passing close to the wingtips.

ACTING TASK
She is reading the gap, not enjoying the view. Eyes go to the next opening before the current one is cleared, and the head turns to hold it through the roll. Hands adjust in small corrections, never in big theatrical pulls.

PHYSICS
The machine banks before it turns. Ring light passes across the wings as a moving reflection. Air disturbance trails behind the wingtips.

LIGHTING
Ring glow throws blue across the underside of the wings on each pass. Warm ambient stays on the top surfaces.

AUDIO
Wind, ring resonance on each pass, no music.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
The glider passes through the centre of every ring. Travel direction holds. No second aircraft enters frame.`,

        prompt: `SCENE CONTEXT
The glider drops into a canyon between two districts, runs low past waterfalls and balconies, then climbs out through the cloud shelf.

@lyrian_v1: pilot pressed low to the frame for the dive. 100% matches the reference.
@skyrunner_v1: glider, wings angled for the descent.
@spires_v1: canyon walls, waterfalls, hanging gardens, cloud shelf above.
@route_v1: position reference for direction of travel only.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
Open inside the canyon with walls filling screen-left and screen-right and the glider centred. The near wall stays within 3 metres of the left wingtip for the first three seconds. Waterfall crosses the path at the midpoint.

OPTICS
16mm on the descent for speed, 24mm on the climb so the cloud layer reads as depth instead of fog.

CAMERA
Chase position, dropping with the glider. On the climb the camera falls slightly behind and looks up, so the machine gains height inside the frame.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 Steep descent between the walls, spray thrown off the waterfall as it passes.
0:02 to 0:04 Low run past lit balconies, wing 2 metres off the stone.
0:04 to 0:06 Pitch up into the cloud shelf, cloud closing over the camera.

PHYSICS
Water spray hits the wings and streams backwards. The machine loses a little speed in the climb and gains it in the dive. Cloud reacts to the wings passing through it.

LIGHTING
Shadow inside the canyon with warm light on the upper rim, then flat bright diffusion inside the cloud.

AUDIO
Wind rising with speed, water, muffled air inside the cloud.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
The canyon walls stay on both sides for the low run. The glider never reverses direction. Rider stays seated and in scale.`,

Above the cloud, the glider crosses in front of a vast spiral in the sky, then rolls over and dives back down towards the water.

@skyrunner_v1: glider in silhouette with the core reading as the brightest point in frame.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
Open with the spiral filling the upper two-thirds of frame and the glider entering from the lower left, crossing towards screen-right. The machine stays in the lower third and never covers the centre of the spiral.

OPTICS
35mm. A tighter field so the spiral holds its shape instead of bending at the frame edge.

CAMERA
Slow chase from slightly above, then a roll with the glider as it turns over into the dive.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 Level cross in front of the spiral, wings catching a rim of light.
0:02 to 0:03 The glider rolls inverted and pitches down.
0:03 to 0:04 Dive out of the cloud towards open water and cliffs below.

PHYSICS
The roll carries momentum through the turn. The rider stays fixed to the frame while the horizon rotates. Speed builds visibly in the dive.

LIGHTING
The spiral is the key light. Everything in the foreground goes to silhouette with a violet rim and one blue point at the nose.

AUDIO
Wind thinning at altitude, a low tone under the spiral, then air building in the dive.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
One aircraft. The spiral stays behind the glider at all times. No extra light sources in frame.`,

        prompt: `SCENE CONTEXT
The glider comes in under a stone arch, skids along a wet terrace and the pilot steps off it already braced for a fight.

@lyrian_v1: pilot dismounting, one hand still on the frame, knees bent. 100% matches the reference.
@skyrunner_v1: glider on the ground, wings still extended, core lit.
@enforcer_v1: 2.2m armoured enforcer, ceramic plate, silver mask, heat blade, standing at the far end of the terrace.
@spires_v1: stone terrace with balustrade, lanterns, crates, waterfalls and city beyond.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
Open low at deck height with the arch filling the upper frame and the glider coming through it towards camera. The terrace runs screen-left to screen-right. @lyrian_v1 lands at centre-left. @enforcer_v1 stands 8 metres away at centre-right, already turning towards her.

OPTICS
24mm at knee height. The low wide angle keeps the pilot small in the frame and the enforcer tall behind her.

CAMERA
Fast track in with the landing, then settle to a static low angle for the dismount.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:01 The glider passes under the arch, nose up, wings flaring.
0:01 to 0:02 It skids across wet stone with sparks and spray, turning side-on as it stops.
0:02 to 0:03 @lyrian_v1 swings off the frame and drops into a low crouch, facing screen-right.

ACTING TASK
She is counting what she has walked into. The eyes find the enforcer first, then the crates, then the exits, then back to the enforcer. The crouch is a decision to stay, not a landing pose.

PHYSICS
Weight transfers from machine to feet. Water sheets away from the skid. The glider keeps rocking slightly after it stops.

LIGHTING
Warm lantern light on the terrace, cold blue from the core beside her, pale sky behind the balustrade.

AUDIO
Metal on wet stone, wings settling, one heavy footstep answering.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
Scale gap stays visible: the pilot reaches the enforcer's hip. Glider stays intact and stays in frame.`,

The pilot fights two enforcers across the terrace, staying inside their reach and using an arcane charge to put one of them down.

ACTIVE REFERENCES
@lyrian_v1: pilot fighting low and fast, blue arcane light gathered in the right hand. 100% matches the reference.
@enforcer_v1: two enforcers, ceramic plate armour, silver masks, heat blades. Both 2.2m.
@spires_v1: terrace, balustrade, lanterns, crates, city beyond.

FIRST FRAME AND SPATIAL BLOCKING
@lyrian_v1 holds the left half of frame throughout. The first enforcer attacks from screen-right, the second enters from behind him at 0:03. Neither enforcer crosses to the left of the pilot. The crates stay in the right foreground as a fixed landmark.

OPTICS
28mm at chest height for the exchanges, 40mm for the closing wide. Camera height stays low, so every frame reports the size difference.

CAMERA
Handheld with weight. It moves with her on each dodge and is knocked slightly on each blade impact.

ACTION TIMING
0:00 to 0:02 The first enforcer swings down. She rolls inside the arc and releases the charge into his chest, throwing him back.
0:02 to 0:04 HARD CUT. She vaults a crate as the second enforcer swings through it, splinters thrown across frame.
0:04 to 0:06 She lands screen-left, low, blue light building again in her hand.
0:06 to 0:07 Both settle facing each other across the terrace and hold to the final frame.

ACTING TASK
She is measuring reach and buying distance. After every exchange the eyes check the blade hand first and the feet second, and the breathing is working. He is trying to end it in one move and reads as slower each time he misses.

PHYSICS
Armour carries momentum and lands hard. Wood breaks along the grain. Wet stone gives under her feet on each turn. The charge throws light before it throws the body.

LIGHTING
Lantern warmth as the base, blue flash from the charge as a moment of key light, pale sky keeping the silhouettes readable.

AUDIO
Armour, splintering wood, one low concussive release, breathing.

POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS
Two enforcers only. Screen sides fixed. The final frame is static with all three figures in shot.`,
